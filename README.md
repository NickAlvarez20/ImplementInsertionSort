## Project Name
Implement Insertion Sort
## About
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm in JavaScript. Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting each element into its correct position among the previously sorted elements. It is efficient for small datasets and nearly sorted data. The project includes a helper function insert to handle the insertion process and test cases to verify the sorting functionality.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need JavaScript installed on your system (e.g., Node.js or a browser environment). No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This Implement Insertion Sort includes these features:

-Core implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm in JavaScript

-Helper function insert for inserting elements into the correct position

-Example usage with two sample unsorted arrays

-In-place sorting to minimize memory usage

-Test cases to verify correct sorting with assertions

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine: 

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/ImplementInsertionSort.git`
## Usage
Run the JavaScript script (e.g., node insertion_sort.js) in a JavaScript environment (e.g., Node.js or a browser console). The script will sort the provided arrays and output the results
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Understand the mechanics of the Insertion Sort algorithm and its step-by-step insertion process

-Implement and test a quadratic time complexity sorting method (O(n²) average case) in JavaScript

-Gain hands-on experience with array manipulation, loop-based logic, and function composition in JavaScript

-Practice writing modular code with a separate insertion helper function

-Learn to include assertion-based testing to validate sorting correctness
